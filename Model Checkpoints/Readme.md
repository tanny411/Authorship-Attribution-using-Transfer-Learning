## Model Checkpoints

Several models were trained and fine-tuned to perform classification for Authorship Attribution in Bangla Literature. This folder and readme help keep track of all these model checkpoints. Especially the checkpoints from training models with news corpus and bn.wikipedia.org dumps serve as pre-trained language models for any Bangla downstream tasks. The list below gives a breakdown of all the model checkpoints.
